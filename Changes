1.06 Mon May 31 20:58:15 GMT+2 2004
    - adding some tests
    - Apply patches for bugs reported in RT #1854 and #5823
    - Explicit undef as return value was replaced by return with nothing. 
        This might cause bad code such as this 
        
        @a = $upload->file_handle;
        
        that relies on undef in list context to fail.
